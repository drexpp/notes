### Introduction to JavaScript and ECMAScript6



* Difference between **`var, let and const`**
   - Var: Declare a variable, it is weak in ECMAScript 6, since the variable might or might not be reassigned. (Use `var` for variables within the scope of a function, but can also be used outside of a function)
   - Let: Its use is limited to block-scope, they are more specific about errores, better suited than  `var`
   - Const: Protect variables from being overwritten, `const` and `let` are block-scoped. `Const` allows mutability if the object or data structure is mutable (for example `Array`)
   

- Use of **`this`**
