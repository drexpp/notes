### Machine learning
* Russell and Norvig - Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach (18.2 libro)

  - In unsupervised learning the agent learns patterns in the input even though no explicit feedback is supplied. The most common unsupervised learning task is clustering: detecting
potentially useful clusters of input examples.
  - In reinforcement learning the agent learns from a series of reinforcements—rewards or punishments.
  - In supervised learning the agent observes some example input–output pairs and learns a function that maps from input to output.
