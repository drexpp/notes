### Machine learning

  - In unsupervised learning the agent learns patterns in the input even though no explicit feedback is supplied. The most common unsupervised learning task is clustering: detecting potentially useful clusters of input examples.
  - In reinforcement learning the agent learns from a series of reinforcements—rewards or punishments.
  - In supervised learning the agent observes some example input–output pairs and learns a function that maps from input to output. (You are already giving to the algorithm the "right" data, and we want to make predicitions out of it) (**Classification/forecasting or predictions**, in the example of predictions in an simple chase the value of exe Y is discrete, meaning it can only take certain values, rather than continuous).

  (The learning agent can theoretically maximize its expected utility by choosing the hypothesis
that minimizes expected loss over all input–output pairs it will see)

 - **LINEAR REGRESSION**

In order to minimize J(Theta) we will use a mathematical method called "**Gradient descent**"

 Where the partial derivative of J(Theta) is: **Remember chain rule**
