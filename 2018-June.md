- We finally render the component after the desired tag (id="root" in our index.html page), under the hood it uses
`WEBPACK` to create a bundle at the end of our index.html once it is started (we can check the bundle.js file at the end
of our deployed localhost page).

- We adding a constructor for defining the state of the application and we created a tasks.json file which can simulate the process of retriving data from a DB

### Python

- Fastest implementations for checking palindromes

```
def checkPalindrome(inputString):
    return inputString == inputString[::-1]
```

```
def checkPalindrome(inputString):
    start_index = 0
    end_index = len(inputString)-1
    
    while end_index > start_index:
        if inputString[start_index] != inputString[end_index]:
            return False
        
        start_index += 1
        end_index   -= 1
    
    return True
```
