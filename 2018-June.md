- We finally render the component after the desired tag (id="root" in our index.html page), under the hood it uses
`WEBPACK` to create a bundle at the end of our index.html once it is started (we can check the bundle.js file at the end
of our deployed localhost page).

- We adding a constructor for defining the state of the application and we created a tasks.json file which can simulate the process of retriving data from a DB
